## 1. Introduction

MorphFun is a fun and interactive application that combines audio processing and computer vision to transform your melodies into a symphony of instruments. Users can record themselves singing or whistling a melody and watch as their performance is translated into the sounds of four distinct instruments: Violin, Flute, Trumpet, and Tenor Saxophone. With the power of Timbre Transfer and Pose Estimation, MorphFun brings a new dimension to music creation.

## 2. Features

### DDSP - Neural Timbre Transfer

MorphFun harnesses the power of DDSP (Differentiable Digital Signal Processing) from Magenta, a Google Research project, for Neural Timbre Transfer. DDSP is a groundbreaking technique that allows us to modify the timbre, pitch, and dynamics of audio signals in a highly controllable manner.

With DDSP, MorphFun takes your recorded audio and performs a remarkable transformation. It not only replicates the melody but also allows you to choose from four distinct timbres: Violin, Flute, Trumpet, and Tenor Saxophone. This means that your vocal or whistle performance can instantly sound like it's being played by a professional instrumentalist. It's a magical fusion of your creativity and the art of music.

### Pose Estimation with Mediapipe Holistic

MorphFun incorporates the cutting-edge Mediapipe Holistic model for Pose Estimation. This model goes beyond traditional pose estimation by providing a comprehensive understanding of the body's movements. It extracts key points and landmarks representing the pose of your face, limbs, and hand, capturing even the subtlest nuances of your performance.

This real-time Pose Estimation is the foundation of MorphFun's interactive experience, enabling the application to track your movements and translate them into musical instrument choices.

### Custom Pose Classification Model

What sets MorphFun apart is its custom Pose Classification model. We have trained our own LSTM-based neural network to analyze the sequences of keypoints generated by Pose Estimation. This model is tailored specifically for recognizing your "musical pose" and classifying it into one of five categories: Violin, Flute, Trumpet, Tenor Saxophone, or "No Instrument" if you're not mimicking any instrument.

This personalized model ensures accurate and responsive instrument selection, making your MorphFun experience feel uniquely tailored to your performance.

With these advanced features, MorphFun transforms your webcam and microphone into a musical playground, offering endless possibilities for creative expression. Explore the depths of timbre transfer, pose estimation, and classification to craft your musical masterpiece.

### Interactive Control

MorphFun provides an easy-to-use GUI with three buttons:
- **REC**: Start and stop audio recording.
- **Pause/Play**: Pause or resume audio playback.
- **Clear**: Reset your session for a fresh start.

## 3. Getting Started

To experience the musical magic of MorphFun, follow these steps:

## 4. Installation
Before running the application, ensure you have the required dependencies installed. You can do this by creating a Conda environment with Python 3.8.18 and then installing the dependencies using the provided `requirements.txt` file:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the following command to create a Conda environment with Python 3.8.18:
```bash
conda create -n morphfun python=3.8.18
```

### Install Dependencies
5. After creating the Conda environment, activate it using the following command (on Windows, replace `source` with `conda activate`):
```bash
source activate morphfun
```

6. Finally, install the project dependencies using `pip` and the provided `requirements.txt` file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 5. Usage
